Factorio Utilities
==================

Loose collection of utilities for factorio modding.

Contains functionality for mathematics, tables, strings, output, entities and prototypes. Additionally it contains a system for storing data chunk-wise and a system for queueing the spawning of entities on specific chunks before the chunks are generated.

Currently of dubious quality since a number of these have recently been modified but not tested.
