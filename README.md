unique2's Factorio Utilities
============================

 Aims to extend the Factorio Lua API with badly tested, undocumented, and easy-to-use functions to make modding easier. 

Loose collection of utilities for factorio modding.

Contains functionality for mathematics, tables, strings, output, entities, prototypes and scenarios. Additionally it contains a system for storing data chunk-wise and a system for queueing the spawning of entities on specific chunks before the chunks are generated.
